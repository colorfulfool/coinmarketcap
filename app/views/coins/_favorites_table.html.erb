  If you like the coin, then do some Technical Analysis on itâ€™s price action, both short term and long term, and draw trend lines.<br><br> TA will help you find buying and selling zones for entries and exits, but most importantly it will give you what you should refer to from now on as your system for risk management (ie - stop losses).
